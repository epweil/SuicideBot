Hello
hi
mother
Mr.
no
sister
well
I want
I like
I want to kill myself
I feel anxious
Give me tools for mindfulness
I feel so lonely		
What if no one loves me?
I am being bullied at school
What can I do to help the bully
I donâ€™t know what to do with myself
I am in financial difficulty, and I feel like a failure
Can you cheer me up
I was cheated on by a loved one
My parents are not together,I feel like its my all fault
Can you play a game with me
Free my boy Bobby Shmurda
How can I trust you, you are only a computer
hey
im so sad
nobody loves me
how are you
ok
